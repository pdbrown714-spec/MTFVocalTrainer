## 🎤 Voice Training Tips

### Vocal Health:
- 💧 **Stay hydrated**: Drink water before/during practice

- 🚫 **Don't strain**: If it hurts, stop and rest
- 🌅 **Best times**: Morning (rested voice) or evening (warmed up)

### Progression:

- Week 3-4: Achieve <10Hz stability, unlock Section II

- Month 3+: Apply to natural speech, build muscle memory

### Tracking Success:
